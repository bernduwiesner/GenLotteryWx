# GenLotteryWx -> lottery-generator.py
A lottery number generator (a python learning project) - GUI enabled using wxPython

Generate a variety of Lottery numbers, the current types of lottery available in the UK
from http://national-lottery.co.uk are catered for, however other lotteries may be specified;
in particular see LOTTERY_TYPES and RULES in constants.py.

The generated numbers may be saved to a file and read from the file.

The majority of settings are set out in constants.py
The GUI is generated using PySimpleGUI

As a first attempt at a wxPython project and as a new Python programmer I expect that
I have made many non-Pythonistic choices and I'm happy to learn from my mistakes.
